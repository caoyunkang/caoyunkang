I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree (2020.09 - Present) in Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, under the supervision of [Prof. Weiming Shen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=FuSHsx4AAAAJ). My passion lies in developing novel algorithms and techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of anomaly detection in complex images.
